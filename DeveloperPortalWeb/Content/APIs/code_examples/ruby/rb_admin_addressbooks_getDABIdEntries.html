# Calls the API to retrieve a list of dynamic entries in an address book.
#
# * *Arguments* :
#  - +token+ -> a token hash    
#  - +addressBookID+ -> ID of address book
#  - +top+ -> number of records to return
#  - +skip+ -> number of records to skip
#  - +fullLoad+ -> indicates if all entries should be returned; either fullLoad or updatedSince is required
#  - +orderby+ -> list of fields to order results by
#  - +updatedSince+ -> Returns all entries updated since this ISO-8601 formatted time
#  - +searchString+ -> Returns all objects with the value in key fields
#  - +fields+ -> list of elements to return in response
#
# * *Returns* :
#   - a list of entries of an address book in the business unit
#
# * *Raises* :
#   - +ArgumentError+ -> if the token doesn't have the expected fields
