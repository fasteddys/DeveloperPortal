<p>
	The Admin API is a collection of API calls that deal with system objects in the NICE CXone system. For instance, the Admin API will allow you to change skill assignments for agents. The Admin API also includes some admin-level functions, such as recording or monitoring a call, or remotely logging off an agent.

<h3 class="primary-color">General Requirements</h3>
<p>
	To use any of the NICE CXone APIs in your application, you must have an API authentication token from the token service. See the @Html.ActionLink("API authentication token", "APIAuthenticationToken", "Documentation") tutorial for information on what type of token is needed for your application and @Html.ActionLink("getting started", "GettingStarted", "Documentation") tutorial to get to know how to get an API authentication token.
