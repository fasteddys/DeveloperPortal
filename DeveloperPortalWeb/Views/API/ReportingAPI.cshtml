<p>
    The Reporting API scope contains a collection of API methods that returns various types of calculated data from the NICE CXone platform.  The main difference between this and the RealTime API is that Reporting APIs require some kind of time frame overwhich these metrics will be calculated.  These APIs can have limits over the the length of these time durations as well as how far into the past they look.

    <b class="primary-color">Note:</b> Contact Data needs at least 15 minutes to migrate to the data warehouse before it should be queried/requested and expected to be 100% accurate.

<h3 class="primary-color">General Requirements</h3>
<p>
    To use any of the NICE CXone APIs in your application, you must have an API authentication token from the token service. See the @Html.ActionLink("API authentication token", "APIAuthenticationToken", "Documentation") tutorial for information on what type of token is needed for your application and @Html.ActionLink("getting started", "GettingStarted", "Documentation") tutorial to get to know how to get an API authentication token.
