<h3 class="primary-color margin-top-none">HoursOfOperation</h3>

<p>
    This event will be delivered if a transfer request is made to a skill queue that is configured with hours of operation, and if the current time is outside of those hours. The platform will send this event to indicate that the skill is currently "closed" per the configuration, and will indicate whether or not the skill is configured to allow a "continue" request, which will queue the transfer to the skill even though it is closed.
