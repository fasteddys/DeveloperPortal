<p>
    Call Contact Events are events that are related to phone calls that are either routed to the agent (inbound, or dialer-generated outbound), or placed by the agent (manual outbound).
</p>
<p>
    There is only one "call contact event" structure. The event structure contains a "Status" field that identifies the status of the contact. For instance, you will receive an "Incoming" status when a call is first being routed to the agent (while the agent leg is being called). You will receive an "Active" status when a call is finally connected to the agent leg. You will receive a "Disconnected" status when the call is ended by either the agent or the caller. There are other call statuses you can receive. The structure of the event is the same for each of them.

If the ratio of outbound call attempts is greater than 1:1 (meaning more than one outbound call is being placed concurrently for each agent), the agent session will receive CallContactEvent notices for each of the outbound calls that are assigned to the agent.

When the voice path for a call is torn down, the agent session will receive a "Disconnected" status in a CallContactEvent. But if the agent is moved into an Unavailable/ACW state, the contact will still be "active" in the system, and the FinalState property of the CallContactEvent will be "false". Time will be counted towards the overall handle time for the contact during this phase. When the ACW state finally ends, the contact will be completely closed out, and the agent will receive a Disconnected status event with the FinalState property set to "true".</td>

If the call was requeued to the dialer as a "callback", the original handling agent is able to enter "callback notes" for the call. These should be displayed to the next agent to handle the call record. In addition, dialer list entries can have values that are considered "custom values" that should be displayed to the agent. The callback notes and custom field display values are delivered in the OtherInformation field as HTML data.</td>
